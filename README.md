### This project is about cleaning a dataset obtained from this link below:
[link](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks)

The dataset is about global shark attacks that have been registered from (and I'm not kidding) the year 5 and year 77 b.C and then starting to be more
complete and insightful from the year 1700 and on.
This dataset registers so many data (as you can realize from the years that are stored in it). It stores complete dates, types of death, country and locations,
the activity that the person or people were doing, sex, age, and so on.
All this data comes kind or organized but at the same time is so blurry and has so much rows with zero information to be analyzed.
We've had to clean all the data in order to get our conclusions based on some hypothesis that we developed throughout the process of exploring the chart.
Once we've cleaned all the "NaN" values and all that stuff, we proceeded to analyze the clean data and obtain some conclusions, as the sex most affected by the
shark attacks, the biggest number of attacks based on the age of the people and the most affected countries from this shark attacks throughout the history.
We created a storytelling at the end to show all the data that we placed our eyes upon and to resume all the conclusions that we obtained through analizing
the data by guiding ourselves with some plots/visualizations all the way through!
